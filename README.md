# ░ Ultrasonic sensor Project ░
This is my first IoT (Internet of Things) Project on Ultrasonic Radar using Arduino Software, Arduino Board and Components.



## 1. Introduction
We know everything produces sound wave just by existence and effect flow of air 
around them with their natural frequency. These frequencies are beyond hearing 
range of humans. Wave of frequency range of 20000hz and thereabouts are called 
ultra-sonic wave and these waves can be detected by an ultrasonic sensor which 
helps us to get various knowledge.  
An Ultrasonic detector usually has a transducer which convert sound energy into 
electrical energy and electrical energy into sound energy. They are used for 
measuring object position and orientation, collision avoidance system, surveillance 
system etc. Ultrasonic technology provide relief from problem such as linear 
measurement problem, as it allows user to get non-contact measurements in this way 
distance between object and its speed etc can me easily measured.  
Speed of travel of sound wave depends upon square root of ratio between medium 
density and stiffness. Also, property of speed of sound can also be changed by natural 
environment condition like temperature. So basically, an ultrasonic sensor sends 
ultrasonic waves which travels in air and gets reflected after striking any object. By 
studying the property of reflected wave, we can get knowledge about objects 
distance, position, speed etc. A processing software and an Arduino software is used 
with hardware system for detection of objects various parameters. One of the most 
common application of ultra-sonic sensor is range finding. It is also called as sonar 
which is same as radar in which ultrasonic sound is directed at a particular direction 
and if there is any object in its path it strikes it and gets reflected back and after 
calculation time taken to come back we can determine distance of object.

## 3. Working
To start the Arduino Radar Sensor, you should know the programming 
code. There are two programming codes need to start the radar. One is the Arduino 
UNO and another one is the processing. 
 
After uploading the code to Arduino, the servo sweeping from 0° to 180° and back 
again to 0°. Since the Ultrasonic Sensor is riding the Servo. Now open the processing 
application and run the code. If there is no error then another processing window 
open up. This is a Graphical representation of the data. The Ultrasonic Sensor 
represented in a radar type display. When the Ultrasonic Sensor detects any object 
within its range, the object will be shown on screen as a graphically. 

## 4. Applications
### • Object Position and Orientation:
Ultrasonic sensors can determine the 
position and orientation of objects in their vicinity. This capability is 
crucial in robotics, where precise object manipulation and navigation are 
required. 
 
### • Collision Avoidance Systems: 
In automotive and industrial settings, 
ultrasonic sensors play a vital role in detecting obstacles and preventing 
collisions. They provide real-time feedback to automated systems, 
allowing for safe and efficient operation. 
 
### • Surveillance Systems:
Ultrasonic sensors are used in security systems 
for perimeter monitoring and intrusion detection. They can detect the 
presence of intruders even in low visibility conditions. 
 
### • Non-Contact Measurements: 
Ultrasonic technology overcomes the 
limitations of contact-based measurement methods. By emitting 
ultrasonic waves and analyzing their reflections, non-contact 
measurements of distance, speed, and other parameters become 
possible. 

## 5. Advantages

1. Non-Contact Sensing: Ultrasonic radar systems allow for non
contact sensing, which means they don't require physical contact with the 
objects they detect. This is particularly advantageous in applications 
where physical contact is impractical or undesirable.

measure distances to objects without physical contact. This is useful in 
various applications such as obstacle detection, navigation, and 
automated systems. 
 
3. High Accuracy: Ultrasonic radar systems offer high accuracy in 
distance measurements. They can detect objects with precision, providing 
accurate information about their location and distance from the sensor. 
 
4. Wide Range of Detection: Ultrasonic radar systems can detect 
objects over a wide range, depending on the sensor's capabilities. This 
makes them suitable for applications ranging from close-range obstacle 
detection to long-range surveillance.
